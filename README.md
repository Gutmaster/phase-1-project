This is my phase 1 project for Flatiron School. 
I built a virtual currency exchanger from an old U.S. Treasury API.

The page displays a list of owned currencies in one column, and potential buys in another.
Each currency is represented by a card that has the country name, currency name, exchange rate
and a form to purchase an amount payable in virtual USD, as well as a button to see the inverse exchange rate.

You can search to filter by country or currency name using the input field near the top to find currencies to "buy" and "sell".
